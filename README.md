# Assignments:
(See "Assignments" folder)

The last Part of an assignment is worth the most points for that assignment.
This is because I believe that you don't have to get everything 100% correct
the first time through, and it gives us a chance to go over your program
to make improvements.

* 1: 
  * Part A: Convert a Python program to C++ **(Week 1)**
  * Part B: Update program to use Inheritance and function overloading **(Week 2)**
  * Part C: Update program to use Pointers and Dynamic memory **(Week 3)**
  * Part D: Update to use Polymorphism **(Week 4)**
* 2:
  * Part A: Template storage class **(Week 5)**
  * Part B: Adding searching functionality to class **(Week 6)**
  * Part C: Change class to a Linked List data-type **(Week 7)**
* 3: 
  * Part A: Stack & Queue **(Week 8)**
  * Part B: Final Turn-in
